v0.9.0 Release Notes
====================

Important, backwards-incompatible version format changes:

A) replaced `-' in autoversions with `+'

   This allows correct handling of autoversions by package manager
   because otherwise the debian_revision is calculated incorrectly.

   Enables autoversioning for forked packages to work correctly.

B) fixed untagged autoversions to include a more specific timestamp

   Day-level resolution is not specific enough to differentiate
   which of multiple autoversions created in a single day is the newest.

Examples:
	0-2010.10.2-8284f414 -> 0+2010.10.1+23:48:38+8284f414
	0.8.0-1-gd0e8365     -> 0.8.0+1+gd0e8365
